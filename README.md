# Gaming Backlog Website

This project is a basic web application that can be used to track games and add to a backlog.

Some of the planned features include:
- Being able to add games to the backlog with the title, platform, and a date the user plans on completing the game.
- Information on games will be stored in a MySQL database.
- A list of games from the database will be displayed in an HTML table.
- Dropdown fields whose choices are dynamically generated from database tables, like the platforms list.
- Allow a user to log in and view their own backlog.
- Use sessions to control access to pages, which will log users out after a certain amount of time.
- Use a DateTime calculation to estimate how many days are left to finish a game.
- Each game will have a priority level (High, Medium or Low) so the user can focus on the most important titles first.
- There will be a recommendation page that suggests games to play next based on priority, genre and upcoming target dates.
